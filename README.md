# django_social_media_board

Chat board using Django.

Users are able to register, log in, log out and chat between each other.

## Challenges I faced
* This was my first time using Django and I definitely have to say that it's good that it does many things for you, but what I definitely appreciate is the light weight of Flask.

## Usage

* First, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/mclbdn/django_social_media_board/
```
* Activate your virtual environment.
* Then, install python packages from requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Run `python manage.py makemigrations`.
* Run `python manage.py migrate`.
* Run `python manage.py createsuperuser`.
* Run `python manage.py runserver`.
